### Purpose
Source control, also known as version control or revision control, serves a crucial role in software development. Its primary purpose is to manage changes to a project's source code over time. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its purpose:

1. **History Tracking:**
   - Source control allows developers to track the entire history of changes made to the codebase. Each change, or "commit," is documented along with information about who made the change, when it was made, and why.

2. **Collaboration:**
   - In collaborative software development, multiple developers often work on the same codebase. Source control enables seamless collaboration by allowing different developers to work on different branches or features concurrently. It helps prevent conflicts and provides mechanisms to merge changes.

3. **Code Backup:**
   - Source control acts as a reliable backup system for code. If an error occurs or an undesired change is made, developers can revert to a previous version, ensuring that the project is not irreversibly damaged.

4. **Parallel Development:**
   - Teams can work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Source control provides the ability to create branches, allowing developers to isolate changes until they are ready to be integrated into the main codebase.

5. **Code Review:**
   - Many source control systems facilitate code review processes. Developers can submit their changes for review before integration, ensuring that code quality and best practices are maintained.

6. **Traceability:**
   - Source control enhances traceability by associating each change with specific issues or tasks. This helps in understanding why certain modifications were made and their impact on the overall project.

7. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Source control is often integrated with CI/CD pipelines. This allows for automated testing and deployment, ensuring that changes are validated and deployed to production efficiently.

8. **Rollback Mechanism:**
   - If a release introduces unforeseen issues or bugs, source control enables a quick and controlled rollback to a stable version, minimizing downtime and potential disruptions.
