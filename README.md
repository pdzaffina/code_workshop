 ## Version Control

### Purpose
Version control, also known as source control or revision control, serves a crucial role in software development. Its primary purpose is to manage changes to a project's source code over time. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its purpose:

1. **History Tracking:**
   - Source control allows developers to track the entire history of changes made to the codebase. Each change, or "commit," is documented along with information about who made the change, when it was made, and why.

2. **Collaboration:**
   - In collaborative software development, multiple developers often work on the same codebase. Source control enables seamless collaboration by allowing different developers to work on different branches or features concurrently. It helps prevent conflicts and provides mechanisms to merge changes.

3. **Code Backup:**
   - Source control acts as a reliable backup system for code. If an error occurs or an undesired change is made, developers can revert to a previous version, ensuring that the project is not irreversibly damaged.

4. **Parallel Development:**
   - Teams can work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Source control provides the ability to create branches, allowing developers to isolate changes until they are ready to be integrated into the main codebase.

5. **Code Review:**
   - Many source control systems facilitate code review processes. Developers can submit their changes for review before integration, ensuring that code quality and best practices are maintained.

6. **Traceability:**
   - Source control enhances traceability by associating each change with specific issues or tasks. This helps in understanding why certain modifications were made and their impact on the overall project.

7. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Source control is often integrated with CI/CD pipelines. This allows for automated testing and deployment, ensuring that changes are validated and deployed to production efficiently.

8. **Rollback Mechanism:**
   - If a release introduces unforeseen issues or bugs, source control enables a quick and controlled rollback to a stable version, minimizing downtime and potential disruptions.

### Actions

## Requirements gathering
### Purpose

Managing requirements in an agile software development project using GitHub involves leveraging its features for collaboration, issue tracking, and documentation. Here are step-by-step instructions:

1. **Create a Repository:**
   - Start by creating a new GitHub repository dedicated to your agile project. This will serve as the central repository for all your project-related information.

2. **Establish Project Structure:**
   - Organize your repository with a clear structure. You might create folders for documentation, user stories, acceptance criteria, and any other relevant information. This ensures a systematic arrangement of project artifacts.

3. **Issues for User Stories:**
   - Use GitHub Issues to represent user stories. Each user story becomes an issue. Include a clear title, description, and labels for categorization (e.g., enhancement, feature, etc.).
   - A user story is a concise description of a feature from an end-user perspective. It typically follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [benefit/value]." Here's an example:
     -  **User Story:**
       - "As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account in case I forget my login credentials."
     - **Explanation:**
       - **As a [type of user]:** In this case, it's a "registered user." This specifies the category of users for whom the feature is intended.
  
       - **I want [an action]:** The desired action is "to be able to reset my password." This describes the functionality or behavior that the user is requesting.

       - **So that [benefit/value]:** The reason behind the user's request is "so that I can regain access to my account in case I forget my login credentials." This articulates the value or benefit that the user expects from the proposed feature.

    - This user story is clear, specific, and focused on the user's needs. It sets the stage for the development team to understand the context, purpose, and expected outcome of the requested feature, making it easier to plan and implement the necessary functionality.

4. **Labels for Prioritization:**
   - Utilize labels to prioritize user stories. Labels like "high priority," "medium priority," or "low priority" help in identifying and sorting issues based on their importance.

5. **Assignees and Milestones:**
   - Assign user stories to specific team members by using the "Assignees" field. Additionally, use GitHub milestones to group related user stories together and track progress over specific timeframes, such as sprints.

6. **Enhanced Descriptions:**
   - Provide detailed descriptions for each user story. Include acceptance criteria, constraints, and any additional information necessary for understanding and implementing the requirements.

7. **Discussion and Collaboration:**
   - Leverage the discussion section within each issue to facilitate collaboration. Team members can ask questions, provide feedback, and engage in discussions related to specific user stories.

8. **Use Projects for Sprint Planning:**
   - GitHub Projects can be used to create boards that represent your agile sprints. Create columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Move issues across these columns as they progress through the sprint.

9. **Pull Requests for Changes:**
   - If a user story requires changes or updates, create a new branch, make the necessary modifications, and submit a pull request. This allows for code review and discussion before merging changes into the main branch.

10. **Documentation in the Wiki:**
    - GitHub provides a Wiki feature where you can document additional project-related information, such as requirements documentation, system architecture, and any other relevant details.

11. **Continuous Integration (Optional):**
    - Integrate GitHub Actions or other CI tools to automate testing and ensure that the implemented user stories meet the acceptance criteria before merging into the main branch.

12. **Review and Retrospective:**
    - At the end of each sprint or iteration, conduct a review of completed user stories and hold a retrospective to identify improvements for the next iteration.

By following these steps, you can effectively use GitHub as a collaborative platform for managing requirements in an agile software development project, promoting transparency, collaboration, and efficient tracking of project progress.

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
### Purpose
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are practices in software development that aim to streamline the process of delivering high-quality software. While they are often used together and share similarities, they serve distinct purposes:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - **Purpose:** CI focuses on automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository frequently.
   - **Key Practices:**
     - Developers regularly commit code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
     - Automated build and test processes are triggered on every code commit.
     - Early detection of integration issues, ensuring that new code integrates well with the existing codebase.
   - **Benefits:**
     - Reduces integration issues by identifying and fixing problems early.
     - Enhances collaboration among development teams.
     - Maintains a consistent and stable codebase.

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
   - **Purpose:** CD extends the principles of CI by automating the entire process of preparing code for release, making it ready for deployment to production at any time.
   - **Key Practices:**
     - Automated testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.
     - Automated deployment pipelines that move code through various environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
     - Continuous feedback loops to provide information on the readiness of the software for production.
   - **Benefits:**
     - Accelerates the release process by automating testing and deployment.
     - Reduces manual intervention, minimizing the risk of human errors.
     - Allows for more frequent and reliable releases.

CI focuses on integrating code changes frequently to detect and address integration issues early in the development process. CD, on the other hand, extends this by automating the entire delivery pipeline, ensuring that the software is always in a deployable state, ready for production release. Together, CI/CD practices contribute to a more efficient, reliable, and scalable software development and delivery process.
### Actions
1. commit to branch
## Automated testing
### Purpose
Automated testing serves several important purposes in software development, contributing to the overall quality, efficiency, and reliability of the software development process. Here are the key purposes of automated testing:

1. **Early Detection of Bugs:**
   - Automated testing allows developers to identify and fix bugs and issues early in the development cycle. This helps prevent the accumulation of defects and reduces the cost and effort required for bug fixing later in the process.

2. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):**
   - Automated testing is essential for CI/CD pipelines. It ensures that code changes do not introduce regressions and that the software remains in a deployable state. This enables a faster and more reliable release process.

3. **Regression Testing:**
   - As software evolves, new features or changes can inadvertently introduce issues in existing functionality. Automated tests provide a way to quickly and thoroughly perform regression testing, ensuring that existing features still work as intended after each code change.

4. **Increased Test Coverage:**
   - Automated testing allows for a higher degree of test coverage compared to manual testing alone. It becomes feasible to test a wide range of scenarios, edge cases, and interactions between components, helping to uncover potential issues that might be overlooked manually.

5. **Efficient and Repeatable Testing:**
   - Automated tests can be run repeatedly and consistently, providing reliable and reproducible results. This efficiency is especially valuable for running tests on various configurations, environments, and platforms.

6. **Faster Feedback to Developers:**
   - Automated testing provides rapid feedback to developers, highlighting issues as soon as they occur. This quick feedback loop enables developers to address problems promptly and iterate on their code efficiently.

7. **Time and Cost Savings:**
   - While initial setup of automated tests requires investment, they lead to significant time and cost savings in the long run. Automated tests run faster than manual tests and can be executed more frequently, reducing the overall testing time.

8. **Improved Code Quality:**
   - Automated testing encourages developers to write modular, testable, and maintainable code. It promotes adherence to coding standards and best practices, contributing to overall code quality.

9. **Support for Agile and DevOps Practices:**
   - Automated testing aligns well with agile development methodologies and DevOps practices. It enables continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous delivery, supporting the principles of agility and collaboration.

10. **Documentation and Living Documentation:**
    - Automated tests serve as executable documentation of the expected behavior of the software. They provide a clear and up-to-date understanding of the system's functionality, serving as a form of living documentation.

Automated testing is a critical component of modern software development, offering benefits such as early bug detection, continuous integration support, efficient testing, and overall improvement in software quality and reliability.

### Actions
1. Create a test to run on code commit. Since this is mostly text, use a spell checking test as an exercise.
2. Checking that all links work might also be a god idea.

GitHub Actions itself does not provide a built-in action specifically for spell-checking markdown files with respect to a certain word. However, you can create a custom GitHub Action that integrates with existing spell-checking tools.

Here is a general outline of how you might set up such an action:

1. **Choose a Spell-Checking Tool:**
   - Select a spell-checking tool that supports checking markdown files. Some popular options include `aspell`, `hunspell`, or `markdown-spellcheck`.

2. **Create a GitHub Action Workflow:**
   - Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/spellcheck.yml`) in your repository.

3. **Define the Workflow:**
   - Set up the workflow to trigger on events like `push` or `pull_request`.

```yaml
name: Spell Check Markdown

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
```

4. **Jobs and Steps:**
   - Define jobs and steps for your workflow. Use a setup job to configure the environment and install the spell-checking tool.

```yaml
jobs:
  spellcheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install Spell Checking Tool
      run: npm install -g markdown-spellcheck  # Replace with your chosen tool
```

5. **Spell Check Step:**
   - Add a step to run the spell check on your markdown files. Customize this based on the tool you selected.

```yaml
    - name: Spell Check
      run: markdown-spellcheck '**/*.md'  # Replace with your spell-checking command
```

6. **Filter by Word:**
   - You might need to use additional tools or scripts to filter the results based on a certain word. This might involve parsing the output and checking for the specific word.

Remember to adapt the above example based on the specific spell-checking tool and requirements of your project. Also, check for any updates or new GitHub Actions features introduced after my last knowledge update in January 2022.
